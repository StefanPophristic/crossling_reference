Decision: We should use costs between 0-0.2\
I ran the model on the ["big blue plate", "big red plate", "small blue plate"] scenario. I looked at the global boolean model with alpha values of 1-19 (in increments of 2) and cost values of: \{0, 0.1, 0.2\} versus \{0, 1, 2\}. Cost values were exactly the same for all word types. We found that the cost values of \{0, 0.1, 0.2\} produced a distribution which favored one utterance, but gave non-negligable probabilities for other utterances. The cost values of \{0, 1, 2\} produced distributions which exclusively favored only one utterance. Since increasing alpha size shifted the distribution towards the favored utterance, we decided that cost values of \{0, 0.1, 0.2\} will be more informative for exploring which scenarios should be run in the experiment.}
